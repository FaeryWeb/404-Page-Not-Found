## Overview

- What was your experience?
  - It was fun to try recreate a website from just a figma file.
- What have you learned/improved?
  - I don't have a complete knowledge about how to position things.
  - I have some problems trying it to make it responsive
- Your wisdom? :)
  - Use live server, without it is a lot more difficult to build
